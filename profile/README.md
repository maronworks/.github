# 🛠️ MaronWorks

Welcome to **MaronWorks** — my personal code lab where I try things, break things, and sometimes build something cool.  
This is where my setups, side-projects, snippets, and sandbox experiments live.

> Silly projects welcome. Some code may be cursed, but it’s all part of the process. 🧪

---

## 📂 What You'll Find Here

- 🔧 **Code templates** and setup guides  
- 📦 **Shared modules** and experimental tools  
- 🧪 **Mini-projects**, UI tests, and playground apps  
- 🗃️ **Archived school projects** or legacy ideas (for future me)

---

## 🚀 Why This Exists

While my main GitHub profile (`@ralphmarondev`) is focused on polished, portfolio-ready apps — **MaronWorks** is where the experiments happen. It helps me:

- Keep personal repos uncluttered
- Test new stacks, architectures, or patterns
- Reuse boilerplates across projects
- Learn by building and breaking

## 🙋‍♂️ For Visitors

Most of these projects aren’t meant to be perfect — but they’re real.  
If something here helps you, feel free to fork or adapt it.  
If it looks broken… well, that’s what labs are for. 😅
